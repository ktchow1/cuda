Advancement since classical neural network : 
* process spatial information (image)    ---> convolution neural network 
* process time sequence (text or speech) ---> LSTM


Breakthrough in CNN
* turn homogenous layer in classical NN into heterogenous layer in CNN, hence each layer has specific purpose : 
- convolution layer : 



* kernel & weight sharing
- 
-

* solve vanishing gradient with RELU
* solve with batch-norm & layer-norm
